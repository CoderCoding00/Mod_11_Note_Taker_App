# Note Taker

## Challenge Description and Purpose of the Application

I created an application called Note Taker that writes and saves notes using Express.js for the back end. The data is saved and retrieved from a JSON file. Connected the front and back end and deployed the application to Heroku. 

The Bonus for the assignment was for the user to be able to delete notes. I handled this by using the same basic code that was used to post a note, but adding a new const to filter the array against the note that was to be deleted. 

#

I periodically tested the program from VS Code running on a local host. Once it was ready to be deployed I used Heroku; a cloud application platform where the application can be run. 

The link to the deplyed app on Heroku is below.
